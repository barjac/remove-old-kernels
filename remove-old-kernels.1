.TH remove-old-kernels "10 Jan 2023"
.SH NAME
remove-old-kernels \- Utility to remove obsolete kernels in Mageia Systems using urpme.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBremove-old-kernels\fP [\fI\-option\fP]

\fBrok\fP [\fI\-option\fP] 

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBremove-old-kernels\fR runs automatically under cron.weekly using configuration settings in /etc/remove-old-kernels.cfg. This is the default in order to avoid system failure due to old kernels filling the root file system.
.br
For most users it can be left, as installed, to do it's job without any user intervention or concern.

.br
It keeps the default (3) kernels of EACH kernel flavour, NOT 3 in total. If there are kernels of various flavours installed, then only the flavours with more than 3 would see any removed.

.br
It will never remove the running kernel.

.br
If the running kernel has been accidentally removed by some utility since boot then it will report the error and abort, removing nothing.

\fBremove-old-kernels\fP also allows interactive command\-line removal of kernel packages using various options.

\fBremove-old-kernels\fR with no arguments as a regular user, will display the current kernel(s) installed, the one in use, marked with 'U', and the ones it suggests to remove in red, if any.
.br
This is a good way to make a quick check without any risk of error. 

\fBremove-old-kernels\fP is also available from the Mageia main menu system in graphical desktops for ease of use by users unfamiliar with the command line. Usually found under Tools -> System Tools. It will ask for the root password.

\fBIn automatic mode a log is kept at /var/log/remove-old-kernels.log. The log is limited to 1000 lines (up to a year) and will then start to remove the oldest entries whilst adding new ones. See the -l option to view the log.
.br

.SH DISPLAY

.TP 
\fB\The header bar.
This shows:
.br
The system release information.
.br
The number of kernels found in the /boot directory
.br
Whether the automatic mode is on (1) or off (0). '0' is highlighted in red as a warning when off.
.br
The number of kernels to be kept per flavour.
.br
Whether in advanced mode. e.g.| Q | Not shown when OFF.
.br
The alternate configuration file in use. Not shown for the main configuration file. e.g. F:1 

.TP 
\fB\The list columns.
.br
Column 1 shows the number of kernels found of each flavour.
.br
Column 2 indicates whether the kernel will be kept or removed.
.br
Column 3 shows a key letter to indicate the reason for keeping. Run 'rok -h' for key.
.br
Column 4 shows the full kernel package name concerned.
.br
Column 5 shows the date and time that the kernel was installed.

.SH CONFIGURATION

\fBThe configuration file is /etc/remove-old-kernels.cfg which may be edited manually if desired.
.br
\fBThere are several options below which can also be used more conveniently to change settings in the configuration file
from the command line when run as root.
.br
.br
Several alternate configuration files may be added manually if desired. They must be named as follows:
.br
/etc/remove-old-kernels_N.cfg where N is a digit from 1 to 9.
.br
A template configuration file is provided containing default values which may be copied:
/usr/share/doc/remove-old-kernels/remove-old-kernels_N.cfg.template.
.br
To use a new alternate configuration file for the current run you can use the -f N option, or -F N to switch to it persistently.
NOTE that any changes like auto ON/OFF, or the number of kernels to keep, that are made while running an alternate configuration
will be saved to THAT configuration file. They will not affect the default 'main' configuration.
.br
To switch back to the original configuration use -F 0.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fI\-h -?\fP help

Displays the available options and a key to column 3 of the display.

.TP
\fI\-n N\fP Set the number of kernels to keep. ONLY for the current run.

This parameter sets the number of kernels to keep (this time) in interactive mode. It must be 2 or more, it's value may be restricted by the setting in etc/dnf/dnf.conf if dnf is installed, in which case there is an on-screen warning. dnf sets a default value of 3. 

.TP
\fI\-N N\fP Like -n but stores the 'number of kernels to keep' persistently in the config file. e.g. -N 4

It must be run as root to take effect.

.TP
\fI\-a\fP automatic mode. Run once with no questions asked.

Similar to the weekly cron job and will use settings from /etc/remove-old-kernels.cfg.
.br
It may be used with the -n N option if desired. NOTE: No output is sent to the log when run manually.

.TP
\fI\-A [1|0]\fP Automatic mode ON/OFF switch.

This switches the automatic weekly run ON (1) or OFF (0).
It directly edits /etc/remove-old-kernels.cfg (or an alternate config file if it is currently in use), setting CRON=1 or CRON=0 so must be run as root to have any effect.

.TP
\fI\-c\fP Special option for system automatic mode. This option is NOT intended for manual use.

Checks if CRON=1 is in /etc/remove-old-kernels.cfg before running, or exits. The output is logged to /var/log/remove-old-kernels.log.
It is run by /etc/cron.weekly/remove-old-kernels.cron which also trims the log to 1000 lines if it is greater. This equates to something over one year of use for basic systems.
See the -l option for viewing the log.

.TP
\fI\-f N\fP Switch to an alternate configuration file. ONLY for the current run.

N is any number from 1 to 9. Alternate configuration files need to be prepared in advance.

.TP
\fI\-F N\fP Switch to an alternate configuration file. Persistently. (Must be root)

N is any number from 0 to 9. (0 returns to main configuration file). Alternate configuration files need to be prepared in advance.

.TP
\fI\-t\fP Test mode.

A test mode where no kernel is removed, to show what would be done. NOTE: If combined with options that change configuration then
when run as root those options will still work.

.TP
\fI\-p\fP Preview mode.

Dry run showing the urpme commands that would be used.

.TP
\fI\-q\fP Advanced mode, run once.

An advanced mode (developed for Mageia QA testers).
.br
In addition to the regular mode, when ON this will also NOT remove:
.br
A kernel devel package of the same version as a corresponding installed kernel, unless the kernel is going to be removed as well.
.br
A kernel potentially needed by an installed virtualbox kernel latest.
.br
A kernel potentially needed by an installed xtables-addons kernel latest.

.TP
\fI\-Q N\fP Advanced mode, persistent. OFF by default.
When ON, "Q" is displayed near the right end of the header bar.

N = 1 for enable, 0 to disable. Default disabled.

.TP
\fI\-l \fP Display the log file. (Only created by the weekly automatic runs)
.br
The last ~1000 lines of the log are retained. If no log has yet been created then it will exit.

.TP
\fI\-v\fP Show the version of the installed remove-old-kernels package.

.SH EXAMPLES
\fBrok\fP
.br
A shorthand link to 'remove-old-kernels'. Run as root to remove kernels or change settings.

\fBremove-old-kernels -n4\fP
.br
Remove old kernels interactively, this time, keeping 4 kernels of each flavour.

\fBrok -l\fP
.br
Display the log file.
